/**
 * Airy isostasy for the crustal-column model (docs/CRUSTAL_COLUMN_PROPOSAL.md
 * §2, the `crustalColumns` mechanism): pure helpers, no state imports beyond
 * types. Continental surface elevation is a derived cache of the primary
 * `crustalThicknessM` field:
 *
 *   e(T) = CONTINENTAL_ISOSTASY_DATUM_M + CONTINENTAL_BUOYANCY_FACTOR · T
 *
 * (e(20 km) = −2306 m, e(39 km) = +400 m, e(70 km) = +4815 m). The datum is a
 * FIXED constant — it never reads sea level, which is what keeps the
 * derivation T1-safe by construction. The oceanic branch is deliberately NOT
 * here: oceanic elevation keeps the empirical age-depth machinery verbatim
 * (bathymetry.ts), and oceanic `crustalThicknessM` is ledger bookkeeping
 * pinned at OCEANIC_CRUST_THICKNESS_M in v1.
 *
 * The derived-cache contract (the C1 coherence invariant): every continental
 * elevation writer under the active mechanism stores thickness FIRST, then
 * re-derives elevation from the STORED (Float32-rounded) thickness — so
 * `elevation[i] === fround(C + k · crustalThicknessM[i])` holds bit-exactly
 * for every continental cell after every post-onset step. That is what the
 * derivation-coherence fixture asserts with zero tolerance.
 *
 * Shim-era validity domain (C1–C4, proposal §6): cells the legacy freeboard
 * pump holds below e(T_min) invert to unphysically thin — even negative —
 * columns. This is retained Δ-space bookkeeping, not clamped, so shim
 * equivalence stays exact; nothing physical consumes raw shim-era thickness
 * until stage C5 regularizes it (a declared, reported credit).
 *
 * Determinism: every helper is closed-form arithmetic — no RNG, no loops
 * beyond fixed ascending-index sweeps, no I/O, no input mutation.
